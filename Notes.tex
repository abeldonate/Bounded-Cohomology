\section{The setting}
We briefly introduce the object we are about to study.

In a similar way we define cochain complexes in usual topological cohomology we can define in the same way cochain complexes in group cohomology

\begin{definition}[Cochain complex] Given a discrete group $\Gamma $ and an abelian group $A$, the cochain complex is defined as
\[
  C^n(\Gamma , A) = \{f: \Gamma ^{n+1}\to A\} , \qquad C^n_{b} (\Gamma , A) = \{f:\Gamma ^{n+1}\to  A | f \text{ is bounded}\}
\] 
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Coboundary operator] This operator "raises" the degree of the cochain complex $\delta: C^n(\Gamma , A)\to  C^{n+1}(\Gamma , A)$
\[
  \delta f(\gamma_0,\ldots, \gamma_{n+1}) = \sum_{i=0}^{n+1} (-1)^{i}f(\gamma_0, \ldots, \hat{\gamma_i}, \ldots, \gamma_{n+1})
\] 
\end{definition}

It is straightforward to check $\delta^{k+1} \circ \delta^k = 0$

However, if we define directly the cohomology from the above cochain complex, the information encoded in the structure of the group will be lost, treating the group like a set. For that reason we introduce the $\Gamma -$ invariant cochain complex.

\begin{definition}[$\Gamma -$invariant cochain complex] This is the subset of the cochain complex $C^n(\Gamma , A)^\Gamma \subseteq C^n(\Gamma , A)$ whose elements fulfill
  \[
  f(\gamma_0,\ldots, \gamma_n) = f(\gamma\gamma_0,\ldots, \gamma\gamma_n) \quad \ \forall \gamma \in \Gamma 
  \] 
\end{definition}
This is what endows the chains the required structure to properly study a group. For convinience we will shorten the notation and we will make use always $\Gamma -$invariant cochain complex when not specified.

With this in mind we can define now the usual cohomology with the diagram in mind
\[\begin{tikzcd}
	0 & {C^0(\Gamma, A)} & {C^1(\Gamma, A)} & {C^2(\Gamma, A)} & {C^2(\Gamma, A)} & \cdots
	\arrow[from=1-1, to=1-2]
	\arrow["{\delta^0}", from=1-2, to=1-3]
	\arrow["{\delta^1}", from=1-3, to=1-4]
	\arrow["{\delta^2}", from=1-4, to=1-5]
	\arrow["{\delta^3}", from=1-5, to=1-6]
\end{tikzcd}\]

\begin{definition}[Cohomology] We define the group cohomology from the Cochain complex and the coboundaty operator as $\displaystyle H^n = \frac{\ker(\delta^n)}{\im(\delta^{n-1})}$
\end{definition}

This is well defined in both cases, the bounded and the unbounded. We realize that the fact $C_b^n(\Gamma , A)\subseteq C^n(\Gamma , A)$ induces a map called comparison map
\[
c: H_b^n(\Gamma , A) \to  H^n(\Gamma , A)
\] 
The study of this comparison map is fundamental to understand how boundedness can change the setting of the problem.

\section{Inhomogeneous formulation}
To make computations in low degree we usually make use of inhomogeneous complex to transform the trivial action condition in something easier to work with.

We begin by taking the representant of $f$ that has the first coordinate  $1$. 
 \[
f(\gamma_0, \ldots, \gamma_n) = f(1, \gamma_0^{-1}\gamma_1, \gamma_0^{-1}\gamma_2, \ldots, \gamma_0^{-1} \gamma_n)
\] 
and we let
\[
\begin{cases}
 g_1 = \gamma_0^{-1}\gamma_1\\
 g_2 = \gamma_1^{-1}\gamma_2\\
 \vdots\\
 g_n = \gamma_{n-1}^{-1} \gamma_n
\end{cases}
\Rightarrow \quad
f(\gamma_0, \ldots, \gamma_n) 
\leftrightarrow f(1, g_1, g_1g_2, \ldots, g_1g_2\cdots g_n) := h(g_1, g_2, \ldots, g_n)
\] 
And this defines a correspondence between the homogeneous and inhomogeneous complexes, which we denote by $\overline{C}^n$.

It is easy to check that the coboundary operator transforms in the following way 
\begin{definition}[Inhomogeneous coboundary operator]
  \[
	\overline{\delta}^nh(g_1, \ldots, g_{n+1}) = h(g_2, \ldots, g_{n+1}) + \sum_{i=1}^n (-1)^ih(g_1, \ldots, g_ig_{i+1}, \ldots, g_{n+1}) + (-1)^{n+1}h(g_1, \ldots, g_n)
  \] 
\end{definition}

Henceforth we will make use of $h(g_1, \ldots, g_n)$ when working with inhomogeneous complexes and $f(\gamma_0, \ldots, \gamma_n)$ with homogeneous. We forget the bar notation, since could be derived from the context.

Two classical computation follows, the cohomologies $H^0$ and  $H^1$:

\begin{proposition}
For any discrete group $H^0(\Gamma , A) = H^0_{b} (\Gamma , A) = A$
\end{proposition}

\begin{proposition}
For any discrete group $H^1(\Gamma , A) = Hom(\Gamma , A)$  and  $H^1_{b} (\Gamma , \mathbb{Z}) = 0$
\end{proposition}

We might be surprised by the different result that boundedness gives us on the computation of $H^1_{b}$, but this is the consequence of the fact that there are no bounded homomorphisms from $\Gamma $ to $\mathbb{Z}$ or $\mathbb{R}$.

\section{Quasimorphisms}
Compute $H^2_b$ is far more complicated than  $H^0_b$ and  $H^1_b$. There is a classical result that asserts  $H^2$ is in one-to-one correspondence with the isomorphism classes of central extensions of $\Gamma $ by $A$. For the case of bounded cohomology we introduce the idea of quasimorphism.

 \begin{definition}[Quasimorphisms] Let $\Gamma $ a group. The space of quasimorphisms is defined as follows
   \[
	 QM(\Gamma ) = \{f:\Gamma \to \mathbb{R}: \ \exists C>0 \text{ such that } |f(g_1)+f(g_2)-f(g_1g_2)|<C \ \forall g_1, g_2\in \Gamma  \}   
   \] 
\end{definition}

The study of the following map is crucial for the understanding the relationship between quasimorphisms and second order bounded cohomology.
\[\begin{tikzcd}
	{QM(\Gamma)} & {\ker(H_b^2(\Gamma, \mathbb{R})} & {H^2(\Gamma, \mathbb{R}))} 
	\arrow["c", from=1-2, to=1-3]
	\arrow["A", from=1-1, to=1-2]
\end{tikzcd}\]

that sends each quasimorphism $\varphi \in QM(\Gamma )$ into $[\delta^1\varphi ]\in H_b^2$. This is trivially well defined, since $\delta^2\circ \delta^1 \varphi =0$, in such a way that $\delta^1 \varphi  \in \ker(C^1)$, and, thus, is mapped to zero in $H^2(\Gamma, \mathbb{R})$. Taking into account the following diagram:

\begin{minipage}{0.5\textwidth}
\[\begin{tikzcd}
	{C^1} & {C^2} & {C^3} \\
	{C^1_b} & {C^2_b} & {C^3_b}
	\arrow["{\delta^1}", from=1-1, to=1-2]
	\arrow["{\delta^2}", from=1-2, to=1-3]
	\arrow["{\delta^1_b}", from=2-1, to=2-2]
	\arrow["{\delta^1_b}", from=2-2, to=2-3]
	\arrow[hook, from=2-2, to=1-2]
	\arrow[hook, from=2-1, to=1-1]
	\arrow[hook, from=2-3, to=1-3]
\end{tikzcd}\]
\end{minipage}
\begin{minipage}{0.5\textwidth}
\[
  \Rightarrow \qquad
\begin{cases}
  \ker(\delta^2_b) = \ker(\delta^2) \\
  \im(\delta^1_b) \subseteq \im(\delta^1)
\end{cases}
\] 
\end{minipage}

what suggest that there are some coboundaries $\delta^1 \varphi $ of $C^1$ which are not coboundaries of $C^1_b$. This is the case of unbounded $\varphi$ that leads to a quasimorphism (there are a few examples later developed such as Brook's or Rolli's quasimorphisms).

Thus, we can decompose every quasimorphism that maps to zero in the map $A$ as a sum of homomorphism and a bounded function.  $\ker(A) = B(\Gamma, \mathbb{R})\oplus Hom(\Gamma , \mathbb{R})$. By the surjectivity of the map finally we have the isomorphism
\[
\ker(A: H_b^2(\Gamma , \mathbb{R})\to H^2(\Gamma, \mathbb{R})) \cong \frac{QM(\Gamma )}{Hom(\Gamma , \mathbb{R})\oplus B(\Gamma , \mathbb{R})}
\] 

\section{The free group}
We apply now the techniques of bounded cohomology to the study of the free group. We start with the free group of two elements.

\begin{definition}[Free group of two elements] We call $F_2 = \langle a, b \rangle  $ the group of reduced words generated by the alphabet $\{a, b, a^{-1}, b^{-1}\}$
\end{definition}
